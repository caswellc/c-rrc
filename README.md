Two .R code files:
1.	Simulation code which reproduces Tables 1 and 2 in the manuscript. This code was intended to be run on PC. The user may change the parameters indicated at the top of the script to obtain any desired section of Table 1 or 2.
2.	A script which generates a pseudo-dataset and analyzes it in place of the ADNI data used in the manuscript.

Both files analyze simulated data according to the methods described in the manuscript. File 1 does so with 1000 simulation replications; file 2 does so only once.
